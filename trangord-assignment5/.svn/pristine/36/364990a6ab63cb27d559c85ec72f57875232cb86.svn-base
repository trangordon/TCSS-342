TCSS 342 - Data Structures

Assignment 5 Part 2

Modify this file to add answers to the questions below.


Most questions below refer to the Graph.pdf file included with the starter code for this assignment.
Graph.pdf shows the same graph used in part 1 of this assignment.
That graph is referred to as G in this document.

For questions 1 to 6 below answer TRUE or FALSE.

Q1.  Graph G is a digraph.
False
Q2.  Graph G is acyclic.
False
Q3.  Graph G is a weighted graph.
True
Q4.  Graph G is a complete graph.
False
Q5.  In graph G, vertex 1 (Aberdeen) is reachable from vertex 4 (Kennewick).
True
Q6.  Graph G is a connected graph.
True

For questions 7 to 10 below provide short answers.

Q7.  What is the cardinality of the vertex set (|V|) in graph G?
10
Q8.  List the vertices that are adjacent to vertex 9 (Tacoma) in graph G.
5, 7, 10
Q9.  What is the in-degree of vertex 8 (Spokane) in graph G?
3
Q10. What is the cost of the simple path {7, 6, 1} in graph G?
174

Questions 11 - 14 refer to DFS and BFS

Q11. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a depth first search (DFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle).
You may show either the node numbers or the city names.
7-2-6-1-5-9-10-4-8-3
Q12. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of DFS? 
Stack
Q13. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a breadth first search (BFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle).
You may show either the node numbers or the city names.
7-2-6-8-9-1-5-8-10-3-4
Q14. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of BFS?
Queue

Question 15 and 16 below refer to the starter code provide with this assignment.

Q15. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the minimalPath() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.
Finds shortest path from one node to another in a weighted graph

Q16. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the floydShortestPaths() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.
Creates a matrix of the shortest paths from one node to another in a weighted graph

For questions 17 through 20, match the name of the algorithm to the problem in graph theory it is designed to solve (from the A to F list below).
You may need to do a bit of research on the Internet to answer these questions. NOTE: below the list of questions is a list of various problems.
